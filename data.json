TTP aims to push the Pakistani government out of Khyber Pakhtunkwa province (formally known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) and establish Sharia law through acts of terrorism. TTP draws ideological guidance from al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ), while elements of AQ rely in part on TTP for safe haven in areas along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. This arrangement has given TTP access to both AQ\u2019s global terrorist network and its members\u2019 operational expertise.\nTTP has carried out and claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist acts against Pakistani and U.S. interests, including the December 2009 suicide attack on a U.S. military base in Khost, Afghanistan that killed seven U.S. citizens, as well as the April 2010 suicide bombing against the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan that killed six Pakistani citizens. TTP is suspected of involvement in the 2007 assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. TTP directed and facilitated Faisal Shahzad\u2019s failed attempt to detonate an explosive device in New York City\u2019s Times Square on May 1, 2010.\nOn September 1, 2010, the U.S. Department of State designated TTP as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended.
